### prd-data 

Package containing source data for the Policy Rules Database (PRD). 

We separated the data storage and loading from the prd-calculator package (which has this as a dependency.)

See setup.py + MANIFEST.in for how to include files in your package wheel and source ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfyIrX4_yL8))
* Recommend to follow along first and then use [uv build](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
